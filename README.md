# Shopping Cart Exercise

Welcome to the Shopping Cart exercise! In this exercise, you will be working with a basic shopping cart implementation in Python. The `ShoppingCart` class allows you to add items, remove items, calculate statistics, and perform various operations on a shopping cart.

## Instructions

Your task is to complete the following steps:

1. Fork this repository to your GitHub account.
2. Clone the forked repository to your local machine.
3. Open the `shopping_cart.py` file and implement the missing functionalities marked with `# TODO` comments.
4. Write test cases in the `test_shopping_cart.py` file to ensure the correctness of the implemented functionalities.
5. Run the test cases using `python test_shopping_cart.py` and make sure all tests pass.
6. Make any necessary modifications and improvements to the code.
7. Commit and push your changes to your GitHub repository.
8. Submit a pull request to the original repository to share your solution.

## Files

The repository contains the following files:

- `shopping_cart.py`: The main Python file that contains the incomplete `ShoppingCart` class. You need to complete the missing functionalities.
- `test_shopping_cart.py`: The unit tests for the `ShoppingCart` class. You should write additional test cases to cover all scenarios.
- `README.md`: This file, providing instructions and information about the exercise.

## Requirements

To complete this exercise, you need to have the following:

- Python (version 3.6 or above) installed on your machine.
- A text editor or an integrated development environment (IDE) to write and modify Python code.
- Basic knowledge of Python and object-oriented programming concepts.
- Familiarity with writing and running test cases using the `unittest` framework.

## Guidelines

- Read the code comments in the `shopping_cart.py` file to understand the required functionalities.
- Follow the test-driven development (TDD) approach by writing test cases first and then implementing the required functionalities.
- Write clear and concise code with proper variable names and comments to enhance code readability.
- Feel free to add any additional features or improvements to the shopping cart implementation.
- If you face any issues or have any questions, don't hesitate to ask for help.

## Resources

- Python `unittest` documentation: [https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html)
- Git and GitHub documentation: [https://docs.github.com/en](https://docs.github.com/en)

Good luck with the exercise! Happy coding!
